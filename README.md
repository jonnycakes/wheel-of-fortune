### User Stories
User stories can be found [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2021623).

### Explanations of the technologies used
- Reset.css - Used this to remove browser styles.
- normalize.css - Used to edit stylings to make them consistent.
- Bootstrap.css - Installed to get common style elements
- Bootstrap.js - Installed primarily to get my modal window looking awesome. I am going to try for modals rather than alerts!
- jQuery
  - It's a dependency of bootstrap.js
  - It's syntactically easier than vanilla JS

### Approach taken
In order to frame the logic, I went through basic user stories first. I wrote these stories in Pivotal Tracker, and organized it first by how a user would interact with the site.
  - When dealing with these stories, my mindset is to break down each item to it's smallest discernible task. That is, a story shouldn't cover multiple elements (unless they're so tied together both need to be delivered at the same time).
  - I then started labeling some stories as "post-mvp", to try and coordinate my time and effort correctly.

Next up was the wireframe! It's super basic, and it's gonna change.

After that, I started building up my framework. I decided to use jQuery and bootstrap. Bootstrap's gonna make my modals work, and I wanna use this as an opportunity to use the framework.

Next is to organize my user stories and start picking them off.

### Wireframes
Please check out my original wireframe [here](https://wireframe.cc/WdWGJI). I made this the morning of 2017-05-10, and depending on my css powers, I may change this to something more simple.
